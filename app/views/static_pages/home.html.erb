     Welcome to my corner of the Internet.  I've put this site together to archive my projects, thoughts,
     and just give a general sense of what I am up to.  
     This site is still under development, but should be fully online shortly.
     <!-- You'll find some of the essentials highlighted above,
     as well as some of my hobbies - music, photography, and maybe some written word, too. -->
     Feel free to connect
     with me via your social media of choice if you want to, say, discuss any interesting projects, or just say, 'hi.'
